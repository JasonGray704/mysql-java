Project Description:

This was my final Project for SQL and it taught me a deep dive into SQL. We had to createa database that was programed in our IDE and then run in our database application. 
It was easily manuverable and able to be edited from the console. I also loved how each week we just built off of the previoud week and just made the project better and more advanced and complete week to week.
